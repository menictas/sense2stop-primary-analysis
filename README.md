# Sense2stop: Analysis of Micro-Randomized Trial Data

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03184389](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03184389)

## 0. About Sense2stop

The aim of this research is to build systems that can recognize when people 
are stressed and then provide them with relaxation prompts in the moment 
to reduce their likelihood of being stressed, smoking, or overeating in 
the near future. This should help smokers be more effective in their 
attempts to quit by reducing their tendency to lapse when they are 
stressed or experiencing other negative moods or behaviors.

The Sense2Stop study evaluates whether an app and worn sensors can help 
smokers quit smoking and not relapse.
